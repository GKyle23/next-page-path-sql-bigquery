# About This Archive

This repository is intentionally preserved as a **historical snapshot** of work I did around **2016** using **BigQuery Legacy SQL**.

Why keep the legacy syntax?

- It shows my **authentic capability at the time**, without retroactive polish.
- It provides a **reference point** for how analysts approached path and funnel problems in early BigQuery days.
- It may help others understand the **evolution** of BigQuery, from Legacy SQL features like `TABLE_DATE_RANGE` and `EXACT_COUNT_DISTINCT` to todayâ€™s Standard SQL.

**Note:** I do not plan to migrate these queries to Standard SQL within this repository. If you want to modernize the approach, see [`legacy-to-standard-sql-notes.md`](legacy-to-standard-sql-notes.md).
